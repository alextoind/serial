### Disclaimer

_I've started this repository as a fork of [William Woodall's serial](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial), who I really thank (together with all the other contributors) for the great job done so far._

_However I'm going into a deep refactoring of this library and therefore I believe that no PRs will be ever accepted into his repository._

_Only for this reason I've detached the fork from his repository, but I'm going to cherry pick hotfixes if I'll find bugs during refactoring._
